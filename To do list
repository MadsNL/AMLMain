(Flemming) - Try to remove 1 class and classify to see if there are still 7 classes. For all of the 7 classes. 
           If the accurucy on the predictions becomes better, would mean that the removed class is hard to classify because it looks like some other
           class   

(Mads)     - Tjek if the auto encoder works                                             done
(wait)     - Look at encoder - decoder, maybe uptimize

(Mads)      - Make a tree based algorithm only for scalars                              done
(Mads)      - Make a tree based algorithm only for images from auto encoder             done
(Mads)      - Put them together.                                                        done

(Mads)      - Make convolutional NN and see                                             done

(Cecilie og Laura) - Make UMAP on the last dense layer of a NN - Like the auto encoder ith two models in one. 
- Load images in in another way - 

OPTIMIZING:
(Mads)     - How long does the latens space have to be? 
- Test and validation 
- Optimize values with Baysian Optimization.

- Tjek if UMAP or t-SNE is best


PERUVIAN:
- Applie the algorithm to the Peruvian Ice core.
- Find the 20 most interesting images from the Peruvian 
- See if single classes have structure
