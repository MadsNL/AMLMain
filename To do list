(Flemming) - Try to remove 1 class and classify to see if there are still 7 classes. For all of the 7 classes. 
           If the accurucy on the predictions becomes better, would mean that the removed class is hard to classify because it looks like some other
           class   

(Mads)     - Tjek if the auto encoder works                                             done
(wait)     - Look at encoder - decoder, maybe uptimize

(Mads)      - Make a tree based algorithm only for scalars                              done
(Mads)      - Make a tree based algorithm only for images from auto encoder             done
(Mads)      - Put them together.                                                        done

(Mads)      - Make convolutional NN and see                                             done

(Cecilie og Laura) - Make UMAP on the last dense layer of a NN - Like the auto encoder ith two models in one.   done
- Load images in in another way - 

(Laura)      - Put similar classes together and seperate later. Maybe better?

OPTIMIZING:
(Mads)     - How long does the latens space have to be? 
- Test and validation 
- bedre autoencoder?
- Optimize values with Baysian Optimization.

- Tjek if UMAP or t-SNE is best

Stuff from m√∏de
- Umap on encoder
- try with his encoder if want?
- Peruvian has much dust. Dust might overshadow. 
  Plot dust below and then plot others on top in umap
- could try give classifier original size of image?

- remove 1 class. Take last layer or encoder (also CNN classifier (because CNN might be better for the ones we trained on but more biased)). Then Umap parametric on the 6. The. Umap predict on 7 to see if it has another cluster.

- we could try unsupervised with 7 clusters and see how good it is?

PERUVIAN:
- Applie the algorithm to the Peruvian Ice core.
- Find the 20 most interesting images from the Peruvian 
- See if single classes have structure
